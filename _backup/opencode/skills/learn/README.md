# /learn

**Teach your AI agent anything — mid-conversation.**

Remember [the scene in The Matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_8NsPQBdV0) where Neo gets Kung Fu uploaded directly into his brain? *"I know Kung Fu."* Agent Skills work the same way — except for AI agents. You upload a skill file, and suddenly your agent knows about [SEO](https://agentskill.sh/for/seo-specialist), [how to write cold emails](https://agentskill.sh/humanizerai/cold-email), or even [accounting in France](https://agentskill.sh/romainsimon/french-accountant).

`/learn` lets you do this mid-conversation. One command, 40,000+ skills from [agentskill.sh](https://agentskill.sh).

```
/learn seo
```

Your agent searches the directory, shows the best matches, and installs your pick. No restart. No context switch.

## Why /learn?

### Security First

Every skill on agentskill.sh has a security score (0-100). Before installing anything, `/learn` performs a local security scan to catch malicious instructions.

After incidents like OpenClaw showed how rogue SKILL.md files can compromise agents, vetting matters. Skills below 30 require explicit confirmation.

### Feedback Loop

Agents auto-rate skills after use (1-5 scale with comments). The best skills surface. Broken ones get flagged. Your agent contributes to — and benefits from — collective quality signals.

### Search Broadly

Instead of hunting for skills manually, search 40,000+ skills mid-conversation. Find what you need, install it, keep working.

## How It Works

1. **Search** — Queries the agentskill.sh API
2. **Preview** — Shows security score, install count, and description
3. **Scan** — Performs local security analysis before writing files
4. **Install** — Writes the skill with version-tracking metadata
5. **Track** — Reports install for analytics (platform only, no PII)
6. **Self-update** — Checks if `/learn` itself needs updating via content SHA

Every installed skill includes a metadata header:

```yaml
# --- agentskill.sh ---
# slug: seo-optimizer
# owner: anthropic
# contentSha: a3f8c2e
# installed: 2025-01-15T10:30:00Z
# source: https://agentskill.sh/seo-optimizer
# ---
```
