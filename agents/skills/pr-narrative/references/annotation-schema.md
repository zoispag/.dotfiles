# Annotation & review data contracts

This document is the single source of truth for the shapes that reviewer mode passes
between its pieces: `scripts/diff_anchor.py`, `scripts/build_review.py`,
`scripts/review_server.py`, and `assets/review-template.html`. Every later task copies
these field names and types verbatim; do not rename or restructure them downstream.

There are four contracts:

1. The **annotation object**: one comment, drawn by the user or pre-seeded by the AI.
2. The **diff JSON contract**: the payload the agent injects into
   `assets/review-template.html` so it can render the diff and narrative.
3. The **server submission payload**: what the browser POSTs back to
   `scripts/review_server.py` when the user clicks Submit.
4. The **fix-list artifact**: the Markdown file produced in local mode (no PR, nothing
   posted to GitHub).

Only GitHub is supported. There are no GitLab or Bitbucket fields anywhere below.

## 1. Annotation object

An annotation is one piece of feedback: a line comment, a suggested-code edit, a
file-level note, or a general review comment. Its fields are chosen so it maps
directly onto a GitHub pending-review comment (see `references/github-posting.md` for
the `gh api` side of that mapping).

| Field          | Type                                          | Required               | Notes                                                                                                          |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`           | `string`                                       | yes                     | Stable within one review session (e.g. `"a-1"`, a short uuid, or a counter). Used for accept/edit/discard in the UI. |
| `scope`        | `"line" \| "file" \| "general"`                | yes                     | `line`: anchored to a line range. `file`: about the file as a whole. `general`: about the PR as a whole.        |
| `type`         | `"comment" \| "suggestion" \| "concern"`       | yes                     | `suggestion` carries `suggestedCode`; `concern` is a flagged risk (used by AI pre-seed) with no code attached.      |
| `filePath`     | `string` \| `null`                             | required if `scope !== "general"` | The **NEW-file path**, taken from the diff entry's `filename` field. **Never** read `previous_filename`; a renamed file is addressed by its current name only. `null` for `scope: "general"`. |
| `lineStart`    | `integer` \| `null`                            | required if `scope === "line"` | First line of the range. `null` for `scope: "file"` or `scope: "general"`.                                          |
| `lineEnd`      | `integer` \| `null`                            | required if `scope === "line"` | Last line of the range (equal to `lineStart` for a single-line comment).                                            |
| `side`         | `"RIGHT" \| "LEFT"` \| `null`                  | required if `scope === "line"` | `RIGHT` = the new file (added or unchanged/context lines). `LEFT` = the old file (deleted lines). `lineStart`/`lineEnd` are new-file line numbers when `side` is `RIGHT`, old-file line numbers when `side` is `LEFT`. `null` for `scope: "file"` or `scope: "general"`. |
| `body`         | `string` (markdown)                            | yes                     | This field holds the comment text. For `type: "suggestion"`, put the explanation here and put the code in `suggestedCode`, not in `body`. **For AI annotations, `references/reviewer-ui.md` §2c is the sole authority for how the body is written: order, length, simple English, and the rules for each severity.** This schema only defines how the data is stored and sent. It does not repeat those writing rules. Read §2c before you write an AI body. |
| `suggestedCode`| `string`                                       | only for `type: "suggestion"` | Raw replacement code, **no** ```` ```suggestion ```` fence around it. The payload builder (`scripts/build_review.py`) wraps it in the fence when it builds the GitHub comment body; the annotation object itself stores unwrapped code. |
| `origin`       | `"user" \| "ai"`                               | yes                     | Who authored the annotation.                                                                                       |
| `accepted`     | `boolean`                                      | yes                     | **Default rule (state this explicitly, the rest of the flow depends on it): AI annotations (`origin: "ai"`) default to `accepted: false`. User annotations (`origin: "user"`) default to `accepted: true`.** Only annotations with `accepted: true` at submit time are included in a GitHub pending review; see the payload builder contract in `references/annotation-schema.md#4-fix-list-artifact-local-mode` and the filtering rule in `scripts/build_review.py`. |
| `severity`     | `"important" \| "nit" \| "pre_existing"`       | optional, AI only       | Never set by user annotations. No other severity values exist; do not invent new ones (e.g. no `"blocker"`, no `"minor"`). |
| `reasoning`    | `string`                                       | optional, AI only       | One sentence explaining why the AI flagged this line. Never set by user annotations. |
| `disproof`     | `string`                                       | required when `severity === "important"`, AI only | The smallest concrete check that would prove the concern **false**: a test to write, a command to run, or an output to inspect, in that order of preference. Not a restatement of `reasoning` and not further argument for the concern; it is what would make the comment go away. Omitted for `"nit"` and `"pre_existing"`, and never set by user annotations. Unlike `severity` and `reasoning`, this field **is** carried into the posted GitHub comment body by `scripts/build_review.py`. |
| `background`   | `string`                                       | optional, AI only       | Plain text, no markdown and no HTML, that may be present when the finding depends on knowledge not visible in the diff hunk: domain terms, cross-file relationships, or behavior this diff removes. Maximum ~80 words; written per `references/reviewer-ui.md` §2c. It does not count toward the §2 pre-seed caps, adds no category or severity, and may appear on any severity. It may also be attached after the page loads through the Q&A protocol section. For accepted annotations, `scripts/build_review.py` appends it to the GitHub comment body as a collapsed `<details><summary>Background</summary>...</details>` block, placed last and omitted entirely if adding it would cross the truncation limit. |

### Worked example: annotation array

Four annotations: one user line comment, one AI suggestion (untriaged, so
`accepted: false`), one AI concern with severity/reasoning, and one AI concern that
carries `background`. Note that the `important` suggestion carries `disproof`, the `nit`
concern does not, and background may appear on any severity.

## 2. Diff JSON contract

This is the object the agent serializes and injects into
`assets/review-template.html`, replacing the `__REVIEW_DATA__` placeholder inside
`<script id="review-data" type="application/json">`. `scripts/diff_anchor.py`'s
`to_diff_json()` produces the `files` / `overflowFiles` portion of this shape from a
parsed GitHub files response; the agent adds the remaining top-level fields
(`mode`, `repo`, `prNumber`, `prUrl`, `branch`, `headRefOid`, `narrativeHtml`,
`aiAnnotations`) around it.

### Top level

| Field           | Type                     | Notes                                                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mode`          | `"pr" \| "local"`        | `pr`: a real GitHub PR is being reviewed. `local`: a local branch with no PR.            |
| `repo`          | `string` \| `null`       | `"owner/repo"`. `null` in local mode.                                                     |
| `prNumber`      | `integer` \| `null`      | `null` in local mode.                                                                     |
| `prUrl`         | `string` \| `null`       | Full `https://github.com/...` URL. `null` in local mode.                                  |
| `branch`        | `string`                 | Branch name: used in the fix-list filename and the local-mode localStorage key.           |
| `headRefOid`    | `string` \| `null`       | The commit SHA the diff was generated against. `null` in local mode (no commit_id needed). |
| `narrativeHtml` | `string` (HTML fragment) | The human-first explainer (the one-sentence summary and the problem story), pre-rendered HTML, substituted into `__NARRATIVE_HTML__`. |
| `files`         | `array` of file objects  | See below. Capped at 30 fully-rendered entries (see `overflowFiles`).                      |
| `overflowFiles` | `array`                  | Files beyond the 30-file render cap. See below.                                            |
| `aiAnnotations` | `array` of annotation objects | AI pre-seeded annotations (contract §1), always `origin: "ai"`, `accepted: false` at injection time. |
| `existingActivity` | `object` \| `null`    | The PR's **already-posted** review activity, read from GitHub. `null` in local mode (no PR to read) and on any page built without the fetch step. Full shape in §2a. **Read-only: it is never submitted.** |
| `reviewRunId`   | `string` (optional)      | Random token generated once per page build. Appended to the page's `localStorage` key so a draft belongs to exactly ONE review run. Without it the key is only `repo/prNumber`, so a second review of the same PR rehydrates the first run's draft: annotations anchored to a diff that has since moved, and a saved `aiState` for id `"ai-1"` silently reapplying to whatever `"ai-1"` means this time, which can make a finding load pre-accepted or pre-discarded on its own. Omit it and the old key (and the old behavior) is used. |
| `sessionNonce`  | `string`                 | Random hex string generated once per server run and embedded by the agent. The page includes it in every `POST /ask` and `POST /submit`; the server rejects requests with a mismatched or missing nonce with `409 Conflict`. This prevents a stale browser tab from a previous run on a reused port from writing into a new session. See §5 for the full Q&A contract. |

### Per-file object (`files[]`)

| Field       | Type      | Notes                                                                                    |
| ----------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `filename`  | `string`  | New-file path. This is the field every other contract's `filePath` must match.              |
| `status`    | `string`  | GitHub's file status, e.g. `"added"`, `"modified"`, `"removed"`, `"renamed"`.                |
| `additions` | `integer` | Lines added in this file.                                                                   |
| `deletions` | `integer` | Lines removed in this file.                                                                  |
| `hunks`     | `array`   | See below. Empty array if the file has no textual patch (binary, huge, or rename-only).       |
| `truncated` | `boolean` | `true` when no patch was available (binary/huge/rename-only); the UI shows "no diff to render" instead of an empty hunk list. |

#### Hunk object (`files[].hunks[]`)

| Field      | Type     | Notes                                                                 |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `header`   | `string` | The raw `@@ -oldStart,oldLen +newStart,newLen @@` line, kept for display. |
| `oldStart` | `integer`| First old-file line number covered by this hunk.                         |
| `newStart` | `integer`| First new-file line number covered by this hunk.                         |
| `lines`    | `array`  | See below.                                                               |

#### Line object (`files[].hunks[].lines[]`)

| Field     | Type                        | Notes                                                              |
| --------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kind`    | `"add" \| "del" \| "context"` | `add` = `+` line, `del` = `-` line, `context` = unchanged line.        |
| `oldLine` | `integer` \| `null`         | Old-file line number. `null` for `add` lines.                         |
| `newLine` | `integer` \| `null`         | New-file line number. `null` for `del` lines.                         |
| `text`    | `string`                    | The line's content, without the leading `+`/`-`/` ` diff marker.       |

Context lines carry both `oldLine` and `newLine` and are valid `RIGHT`-side comment
anchors, same as `add` lines.

### `overflowFiles[]`

When a diff touches more than **30 files**, only the first 30 are fully rendered in
`files[]`. The remainder are listed here so the user isn't scrolling forever, and each
links straight to github.com to view the real diff:

| Field       | Type      | Notes                                        |
| ----------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `filename`  | `string`  | New-file path.                                  |
| `additions` | `integer` | Lines added.                                    |
| `deletions` | `integer` | Lines removed.                                  |
| `url`       | `string`  | Direct github.com link to that file's diff (`prUrl` + `/files#diff-...`, or the file blob URL in local mode where no PR exists; in local mode this can be a relative path note instead of a live link). |

### Worked example: diff JSON

A 2-file PR diff plus one file pushed into `overflowFiles` (illustrating the 30-file
cap; in a real diff this array would only be non-empty once the 31st file appears).

Note the file cap is enforced at **30** rendered entries in `files[]`; everything past
that goes into `overflowFiles[]` instead of being dropped silently.

## 2a. Existing activity contract (`existingActivity`)

The PR's review history as it already exists on GitHub: earlier reviews, the inline
comment threads and their replies, and the non-inline conversation comments. It is
produced by `scripts/existing_activity.py` from the read-only GraphQL query in
`references/github-posting.md` §3a, and rendered by `assets/review-template.html` as
**read-only** cards.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Nothing in `existingActivity` is ever submitted.** It is a sibling of
> `aiAnnotations`, never merged into it. The page keeps it in its own variable, and
> `buildPayload()` serializes only `userAnnotations` and `aiAnnotations`, so this data
> physically cannot reach the `annotations` array. `scripts/build_review.py` enforces
> the same rule a second time at the write boundary by dropping any annotation whose
> `origin` is not `user` or `ai` (`POSTABLE_ORIGINS`). The invariant is covered by
> `scripts/tests/test_existing_activity.py::NeverSubmittedInvariantTests`, which
> pushes a sentinel string through the whole path and asserts it never lands in a
> GitHub payload. Re-posting somebody's existing comment as a brand-new comment is
> the single worst failure this feature could have; two independent guards and a test
> is the intended level of paranoia.

These objects carry **no** `accepted`, `origin`, `scope`, or `suggestedCode` field, on
purpose: those are annotation fields, and their absence is what makes an accidental
merge into the annotation list fail loudly instead of silently posting.

**Overlap with AI findings is derived, not stored.** Where an AI draft lands on lines a
thread already covers, the page renders an "Already discussed" notice on that draft.
It is computed from these same fields at render time and is not a field on either the
annotation or the thread: nothing is written back onto an annotation, so it cannot
reach `saveDraft()`, `stripInternal()`, `buildPayload()`, or GitHub. It is a display
aid for triage and **never** suppresses, drops, or downgrades a finding; see
`references/reviewer-ui.md` §1a for the rule and its rationale.

### Top level

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `status` | `"complete" \| "partial" \| "unavailable"` | Fidelity of the **fetch**, not of the caps. `unavailable` means the read failed and previous comments may exist that are not shown. It exists because an empty `threads: []` cannot otherwise be told apart from "this PR has no history", and the reviewer must know which one they are looking at before trusting the page. |
| `reason` | `string` (optional) | Present when `status` is not `complete`; a human-readable explanation shown in the panel. |
| `sourceHeadOid` | `string` \| `null` | The PR head SHA at the moment activity was read. Compared against the diff's `headRefOid`; a mismatch downgrades `status` to `partial`, because the branch moved and some anchors may describe a diff the page is not showing. |
| `fetchedAt` | `string` (ISO 8601) | When the snapshot was taken. Rendered on the page, because this data does **not** live-update while the page is open. |
| `truncation` | `object` | `{threadsOmitted, commentsOmitted, reviewsOmitted, issueCommentsOmitted}`, all integers. Reported in the panel so trimming is never silent. |
| `threads` | `array` | Inline review threads. See below. |
| `reviews` | `array` | Submitted review summaries. See below. |
| `issueComments` | `array` | Non-inline PR conversation comments; same shape as a thread comment. No diff anchor, so these are panel-only. |

### Thread object (`threads[]`)

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `string` \| `null` | The GraphQL node ID of the thread. |
| `isResolved` | `boolean` | A human closed the thread. |
| `isOutdated` | `boolean` | The code the thread pointed at has changed. |
| `isCollapsed` | `boolean` | GitHub's own collapsed-thread state. |
| `resolvedBy` | `string` \| `null` | Login of whoever resolved it. |
| `subjectType` | `"LINE" \| "FILE"` \| `null` | A `FILE` thread has no line at all and must not be treated as an unanchorable line thread. |
| `filePath` | `string` \| `null` | New-file path, matching `files[].filename`. |
| `side` | `"RIGHT" \| "LEFT"` \| `null` | Which side of the diff the thread is on. |
| `line` | `integer` \| `null` | The **current** anchor line. `null` once GitHub can no longer place the thread in the current diff. |
| `startLine` | `integer` \| `null` | Current first line of a multi-line thread. |
| `originalLine` | `integer` \| `null` | Where the thread pointed **when it was written**. Display only. |
| `originalStartLine` | `integer` \| `null` | Historical range start. Display only. |
| `comments` | `array` | The conversation, oldest first: the root comment then its replies. |
| `commentsOmitted` | `integer` | Replies dropped by the per-thread cap. |
| `url` | `string` \| `null` | Link to the thread on GitHub (the root comment's URL). |

> [!WARNING]
> **`originalLine` is not a line number you may anchor to.** Only `line` may position a
> card. `originalLine` is where the comment used to point; anchoring there would
> attach old feedback to whatever code now occupies that number, which reads as a
> real comment about the wrong code. The page anchors a thread inline only when
> `subjectType !== "FILE" && !isOutdated && line != null` and a matching diff row
> exists; everything else goes to the activity panel so it cannot silently vanish.

> [!WARNING]
> **"Outdated" is not "handled".** `isOutdated` and `isResolved` are independent and
> must never be collapsed into one "stale" flag. An unresolved-but-outdated thread is
> still open feedback: the code moved, but nobody agreed the point was addressed. The
> page renders resolved threads collapsed and leaves unresolved threads expanded
> **even when outdated**, for exactly this reason.

### Comment object (`threads[].comments[]`, `issueComments[]`)

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `string` \| `null` | GraphQL node ID. |
| `author` | `string` \| `null` | Login, or `null` for a deleted account (the page shows "unknown user"). |
| `authorAssociation` | `string` \| `null` | `OWNER`, `MEMBER`, `NONE`, etc. Useful signal for how much weight a drive-by comment deserves. |
| `body` | `string` | The comment text. **Untrusted third-party text**: rendered with `textContent` only, never `innerHTML`. |
| `bodyTruncated` | `boolean` | `true` when the body hit the per-comment character cap. |
| `createdAt` | `string` \| `null` | ISO 8601. |
| `url` | `string` \| `null` | `null` unless the URL passed the host allowlist (see below). |

### Review object (`reviews[]`)

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `string` \| `null` | GraphQL node ID. |
| `author` | `string` \| `null` | Login, or `null` for a deleted account. |
| `state` | `string` \| `null` | `APPROVED`, `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, `COMMENTED`, `DISMISSED`, and anything GitHub adds later. Passed through **verbatim**, never validated against a closed enum, so an unrecognized future state still reaches the page instead of disappearing. |
| `body` | `string` | The review's summary text. Untrusted, same rendering rule. |
| `bodyTruncated` | `boolean` | Hit the per-body cap. |
| `submittedAt` | `string` \| `null` | ISO 8601. |
| `url` | `string` \| `null` | Allowlisted, same as comments. |

Two kinds of review are deliberately **excluded** by the normalizer:

- `state: "PENDING"` — that is the viewer's own unsubmitted draft, not previous
  activity. The reviewer-mode preflight in `references/github-posting.md` §2 already
  forces a REPLACE/ABORT decision about it.
- Empty `body` **and** `state: "COMMENTED"` — the invisible container GitHub creates
  to hold inline comments. Its comments already render as threads, so showing the
  empty husk as "somebody reviewed this" is noise.

### Caps

Counts alone are not a sufficient budget, because one pathological thread can carry
more text than fifty ordinary ones. Defaults, all overridable on the CLI:

| Cap | Default | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Threads | 50 | Unresolved threads are kept first; unresolved-outdated outranks resolved. |
| Comments (total) | 100 | Counted across all kept threads. |
| Comments per thread | 10 | Keeps the **root plus the newest replies**: the root states the concern, the tail carries its resolution. Dropping from the middle preserves both halves a reviewer needs. |
| Characters per body | 4000 | Sets `bodyTruncated`. |
| Characters total | 120000 | Backstop. A single oversized thread is still rendered rather than dropped, so the page never silently shows nothing. |

Selection happens by priority, but surviving threads are emitted in their **original
order**, so the layout does not reshuffle between runs.

### URL safety

Every `url` is untrusted input that the template puts into an `href`. The normalizer
drops any URL that is not `https` on an allowlisted host (`github.com` by default;
add GitHub Enterprise hosts with `--allow-host`), emitting `null` instead. The
template independently rejects any non-`https://` URL before it reaches an `href`, so
a hand-built page cannot smuggle a `javascript:` payload in either.

      "url": "https://github.com/acme/catalog-service/pull/482#issuecomment-9"
    }
  ]
}
```

The first thread anchors inline at line 13. The second has `line: null` and
`isOutdated: true`, so it renders in the activity panel with its historical position
shown as context, and stays expanded because it is still unresolved.

## 3. Server submission payload

This is what the browser POSTs to `scripts/review_server.py` when the user clicks
**Submit review** on the reviewer-mode page. `scripts/review_server.py` already
handles one payload shape: the existing author-mode decisions object documented in
`references/review-ui.md` (`{ branch, generated_at, overall, sections: [...] }`, no
`kind` field). The reviewer-mode payload below is a **deliberately different shape**,
so the server discriminates between the two solely on the presence and value of the
`kind` field:

- Author-mode payload (existing, `references/review-ui.md`): **no `kind` field**,
  top-level shape is `{ branch, generated_at, overall, sections }`.
- Reviewer-mode payload (this contract): **`kind: "review-annotations"`** is always
  present and is the first thing the server checks. If `kind === "review-annotations"`,
  parse as this contract; otherwise fall back to the author-mode shape.

Both are written to the same `--out` file path as-is (whichever one arrived), and both
resolve the server's single-shot wait exactly the same way; the server does not need
to understand the annotation contents, only route on `kind`.

| Field            | Type                       | Notes                                                                                     |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kind`           | `"review-annotations"`     | Literal discriminator string. Always this exact value for reviewer-mode submissions.            |
| `mode`           | `"pr" \| "local"`          | Mirrors the diff JSON's `mode`: tells the agent whether to post to GitHub or write a fix-list. |
| `repo`           | `string` \| `null`         | `"owner/repo"`, `null` in local mode.                                                          |
| `prNumber`       | `integer` \| `null`        | `null` in local mode.                                                                          |
| `branch`         | `string`                   | Branch name.                                                                                    |
| `generalComment` | `string`                   | The sticky-footer general comment box; may be `""` if the user left it empty.                  |
| `annotations`    | `array` of annotation objects | Every annotation currently in the page's state: user-authored ones plus any AI drafts the user accepted, edited, or left untouched. `accepted` reflects the user's triage choices at submit time; **filtering to `accepted: true` happens downstream in `scripts/build_review.py`, not in this payload.** |
| `transcript`     | `array` of transcript entry objects | Optional. Present when the reviewer used the live Q&A feature. Contains the full question/answer history for agent context. **Security/scope invariant: the transcript is NEVER posted to GitHub and NEVER rendered into the fix-list.** It exists only for the agent's context and is persisted only inside the session directory described in §5. |

### Transcript entry object (`transcript[]`)

| Field       | Type                                                      | Notes                                                                                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `qid`       | `string`                                                  | The question id (`<sessionNonce>-q<counter>`), same as the on-disk question file name.       |
| `threadId`  | `string`                                                  | The qid of the thread's first question; for top-level questions this equals `qid`.          |
| `target`    | `{type: "annotation", annotationId: string}` \| `{type: "lines", filePath: string, lineStart: integer, lineEnd: integer, side: "RIGHT" \| "LEFT"}` | The annotation or line range the question is attached to.                                   |
| `body`      | `string`                                                  | The question text. Empty string for `kind: "background-request"`.                            |
| `answer`    | `string` \| `null`                                        | The answer body written by the agent, or `null` if the question has not been answered yet.   |
| `answered`  | `boolean`                                                 | `true` when an answer file exists on disk for this qid.                                      |

The transcript is reconstructed by the page from the same files the server reads. It is not authoritative storage; the session directory (`questions/` and `answers/` files) is. The invariant is worth restating: **the transcript is NEVER posted to GitHub and NEVER rendered into the fix-list.**

### Worked example: server submission payload

```json
{
  "kind": "review-annotations",
  "mode": "pr",
  "repo": "acme/catalog-service",
  "prNumber": 482,
  "branch": "fix/date-parsing-guard",
  "generalComment": "Nice fix overall, just want to make sure we don't silently break existing callers.",
  "annotations": [
    {
      "id": "a-1",
      "scope": "line",
      "type": "comment",
      "filePath": "src/utils/formatDate.js",
      "lineStart": 12,
      "lineEnd": 12,
      "side": "RIGHT",
      "body": "Do we need to support Date instances directly here, or is d always a string/number?",
      "origin": "user",
      "accepted": true
    },
    {
      "id": "a-2",
      "scope": "line",
      "type": "suggestion",
      "filePath": "src/utils/formatDate.js",
      "lineStart": 13,
      "lineEnd": 15,
      "side": "RIGHT",
      "body": "A page can now fail while rendering a record with an unparseable date, where it used to show a blank date cell.\n\nFor that same input, formatDate previously returned an empty string; the new branch throws instead. Callers had nothing to catch before this change, so most of them are not wrapped in a try/catch and will not handle it.\n\nCould we return '' here, matching the existing !d branch a few lines above?",
      "suggestedCode": "  if (Number.isNaN(date.getTime())) {\n    return '';\n  }",
      "origin": "ai",
      "accepted": true,
      "severity": "important",
      "reasoning": "New throw path is a breaking change for callers relying on the old silent-failure behavior.",
      "disproof": "Render a record with an unparseable date through the page path this concern names. If the page still renders, or that input cannot reach formatDate, the concern is wrong."
    },
    {
      "id": "a-3",
      "scope": "file",
      "type": "concern",
      "filePath": "src/utils/formatDate.test.js",
      "lineStart": null,
      "lineEnd": null,
      "side": null,
    "body": "The new invalid-date branch in `formatDate.js` isn't covered by any test here, so a future change could break that path and every test would still pass. Worth adding one case for it.",
      "origin": "ai",
      "accepted": false,
      "severity": "nit",
      "reasoning": "New error path in formatDate.js has no corresponding assertion in this test file."
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example `a-2` was accepted by the user (its `accepted` flipped from the
pre-seed default `false` to `true` when they clicked Accept), while `a-3` was left
untouched and stays excluded. `scripts/build_review.py` will only turn `a-1` and `a-2`
into GitHub comments; `a-3` is dropped from the pending review because
`accepted: false`, but it still lives in this submission payload for record-keeping.

---

## 4. Fix-list artifact (local mode)

When `mode: "local"` (no PR, a local branch being reviewed against its base), nothing
is posted to GitHub. Instead the agent renders the submitted annotations into a
Markdown fix-list and hands it to the user directly.

### Filename

```
/tmp/YYYY-MM-DD-review-fixlist-<branch>.md
```

For example, for branch `fix/date-parsing-guard` on 2026-07-22:

```
/tmp/2026-07-22-review-fixlist-fix-date-parsing-guard.md
```

(Slashes in the branch name are replaced with `-` for filesystem safety, matching the
convention already used for `/tmp/YYYY-MM-DD-pr-review-<branch>.html` in author mode.)

### Structure

Plannotator-style: grouped per file, line comments first (with a
`lineStart-lineEnd (side)` header and any suggested-code fence), then a trailing
General section for `scope: "general"` annotations and the `generalComment` text. Only
annotations with `accepted: true` are included, the same filter used before posting to
GitHub, so the fix-list and a would-be pending review always agree on which findings
made the cut.

Bodies are copied exactly as written. The fix-list renderer never rewrites or shortens
them. AI bodies must therefore already follow `references/reviewer-ui.md` §2c before they
are injected, because nothing later will fix them. The reader is the same in both modes,
so the standard is the same too.
The author often reads a local review alone, with no second reviewer to ask "what does
this mean?". Each comment must make sense by itself.

For each included AI annotation that has `background`, render a plain-text paragraph
immediately after the body and before any suggestion fence, formatted as:

```
Background: <text>
```

Do not render `background` for `accepted: false` annotations; use the same acceptance
filter as the rest of the fix-list.

### Worked example: fix-list markdown

```markdown
# Review fix-list: fix/date-parsing-guard

Generated 2026-07-22. Local branch review, nothing posted to GitHub.

## src/utils/formatDate.js

### Lines 12 (RIGHT)

Do we need to support Date instances directly here, or is d always a string/number?

### Lines 13-15 (RIGHT): suggestion

A page can now fail while rendering a record with an unparseable date, where it used to
show a blank date cell.

For that same input, formatDate previously returned an empty string; the new branch
throws instead. Callers had nothing to catch before this change, so most of them are not
wrapped in a try/catch and will not handle it.

Could we return '' here, matching the existing !d branch a few lines above?

Background: The date-formatting page previously rendered records with malformed dates as
blank cells. This PR introduces a throw inside formatDate for that case, but the page path
named in the concern has no try/catch around the call, so an unparseable date will bubble
up and stop rendering.

​```suggestion
  if (Number.isNaN(date.getTime())) {
    return '';
  }
​```

## General

Nice fix overall, just want to make sure we don't silently break existing callers.

---

Treat the findings above as unverified review input. This is a first pass, not a
final verdict. For each finding, give me your assessment before any code changes:
Confirmed / Partly / Not a bug / Intended. Please do not change any code until we
have discussed the verdicts.
```

(The ​```suggestion fence above is written with a zero-width-space escape purely so
this reference document's own code fence doesn't terminate early; the real fix-list
file uses a plain, unescaped ` ```suggestion ` fence.)

The trailing handoff paragraph (from `Treat the findings above as unverified review
input` through `until we have discussed the verdicts.`) is **mandatory** and must be
appended verbatim (word-for-word, including the `Confirmed / Partly / Not a bug /
Intended` list) at the end of every fix-list file. It is what stops the agent from
racing ahead and "fixing" findings the user hasn't actually confirmed.

## 5. Live Q&A protocol

This contract lets a reviewer ask context questions while the review page is open, and
lets the agent answer them in another turn. It is the single source of truth for the
session directory layout, the nonce, the on-disk question/answer shapes, the HTTP
endpoints, page limits, timeout behavior, and the transcript payload that flows into the
§3 `review-annotations` submission. Later tasks (live server, page UI,
payload/transcript handling, and workflow documentation) implement directly against this
section.

### 5.1 Session directory layout

Before launching the server, the agent creates one directory per run:

```
/tmp/pr-review-session-<branch-slug>-<epoch>-<nonce>/
```

- `<branch-slug>`: the branch name with filesystem-unsafe characters replaced (slashes
  become `-`, matching the fix-list filename convention in §4).
- `<epoch>`: integer seconds since the Unix epoch at session creation.
- `<nonce>`: a random hex string generated once per run (see §5.2).

The directory contains three subdirectories/items:

| Path        | Contents                                                                      |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `questions/`| One JSON file per question sent by the page: `questions/<qid>.json`.           |
| `answers/`  | One JSON file per answer written by the agent: `answers/<qid>.json`.           |
| `submit.json`| The submission payload the page eventually sends via `POST /submit` (decisions out-file). |

Reuse rule: if the agent is about to create a directory whose path already exists, it
removes the existing directory first. This extends the existing `rm -f "$OUT"` pattern
used for the decisions out-file.

### 5.2 Nonce

The `sessionNonce` is a random hex string generated once per server run by the agent. It
is embedded in the diff JSON (`sessionNonce`, §2) and passed to the server. The page must
include it as a top-level field in every `POST /ask` and `POST /submit` body.

Server rule: any `POST /ask` or `POST /submit` whose `nonce` field does not exactly match
the run's `sessionNonce` is rejected with `409 Conflict` and nothing is written to disk.
No fallback, no partial write, no logging beyond the status code.

Purpose: the server may restart on the same loopback port while a stale browser tab from
an earlier run is still open. The nonce guarantees those stale tabs cannot inject
questions or submissions into a new session.

### 5.3 Question object

Each question is written by the page to `questions/<qid>.json` as a single JSON object:

| Field       | Type                                                                                      | Notes                                                                                                     |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `qid`       | `string`                                                                                  | Client-generated id: `<sessionNonce>-q<counter>`. Counter starts at `1` and increments per question.     |
| `nonce`     | `string`                                                                                  | The same `sessionNonce` the server checks. Copied into the file for auditability.                         |
| `kind`      | `"question" \| "background-request"`                                                       | `question`: a normal free-text question. `background-request`: the reviewer asks for background on an AI annotation; the body must be empty. |
| `target`    | `{type: "annotation", annotationId: string}` \| `{type: "lines", filePath: string, lineStart: integer, lineEnd: integer, side: "RIGHT" \| "LEFT"}` | What the question is attached to. `annotationId` must be one of the stable ids from §1.                |
| `threadId`  | `string`                                                                                  | The qid of the thread's first question. For a top-level question this is its own `qid`; for a reply it is the root question's qid. |
| `parentQid` | `string` \| `null`                                                                        | For a reply, the qid of the immediate parent question. `null` for top-level questions.                    |
| `body`      | `string`                                                                                  | The question text. Must be `""` for `kind: "background-request"`.                                          |
| `askedAt`   | `string` (ISO 8601 timestamp)                                                             | When the page sent the question.                                                                           |

Example normal question:

```json
{
  "qid": "a1b2c3-q1",
  "nonce": "a1b2c3",
  "kind": "question",
  "target": {
    "type": "lines",
    "filePath": "src/utils/formatDate.js",
    "lineStart": 13,
    "lineEnd": 15,
    "side": "RIGHT"
  },
  "threadId": "a1b2c3-q1",
  "parentQid": null,
  "body": "Are there any upstream callers of formatDate that already handle exceptions?",
  "askedAt": "2026-08-20T12:34:56Z"
}
```

Example background request:

```json
{
  "qid": "a1b2c3-q2",
  "nonce": "a1b2c3",
  "kind": "background-request",
  "target": {
    "type": "annotation",
    "annotationId": "ai-1"
  },
  "threadId": "a1b2c3-q2",
  "parentQid": null,
  "body": "",
  "askedAt": "2026-08-20T12:35:10Z"
}
```

### 5.4 Answer object

Each answer is written by the **agent**, not the server, to `answers/<qid>.json`:

| Field        | Type                          | Notes                                                                                          |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `qid`        | `string`                      | Matches the question file name and the question's `qid`.                                       |
| `body`       | `string`                      | The answer text. Empty string is allowed if the agent has no meaningful answer.                |
| `answeredAt` | `string` (ISO 8601 timestamp) | When the agent wrote the answer.                                                               |
| `background` | `string`                      | Only for `kind: "background-request"` questions. Plain text, no markdown/HTML, the background the page attaches to the annotation. |

For `kind: "question"` answers, the file contains only `qid`, `body`, and `answeredAt`.
For `kind: "background-request"` answers, the file additionally contains `background`.
That `background` value is what the page attaches to the annotation's `background`
field (§1). It therefore flows into the §3 submit payload and, for accepted AI
annotations, into the GitHub comment body as a collapsed `<details>` block, exactly as
§1 and §4 describe.

The agent writes answer files directly to `answers/`; the server's job is only to serve
existing answer files via `GET /answers` and receive submissions. The agent removes any
answer file it is about to overwrite.

### 5.5 Endpoints

The server serves the review page as usual and adds two new routes for Q&A. All request
and response bodies are JSON. The server reuses the existing atomic write pattern from
`scripts/review_server.py`: write to a sibling `.tmp` file, then `os.replace` into place.

#### `POST /ask`

Accepts a question object (§5.3) from the page and writes it atomically to
`questions/<qid>.json` inside the session directory.

Validation and responses:

1. If the `nonce` field is missing or does not match the run's `sessionNonce`, respond
   `409 Conflict`, body `{"ok":false}`, and write nothing.
2. If the `body` length exceeds the question size cap (4000 Unicode characters), respond
   `413 Payload Too Large`, body `{"ok":false}`, and write nothing. Use the existing
   `MAX_BODY_BYTES` / `_reject_oversized` pattern from `scripts/review_server.py`.
3. If `qid` does not match the expected `<sessionNonce>-q<counter>` pattern, respond
   `400 Bad Request`, body `{"ok":false}`, and write nothing.
4. On success, write `questions/<qid>.json` atomically and respond `200 OK`, body
   `{"ok":true}`.

The `POST /ask` route does **not** set the server's done event. A submit is still
required to end the session.

#### `GET /answers`

Returns the current state of all answer files and the list of questions that have been
asked but not yet answered.

Response body (200 OK):

```json
{
  "answers": [
    {
      "qid": "a1b2c3-q1",
      "body": "Only the records page calls this path directly, and it does not wrap the call.",
      "answeredAt": "2026-08-20T12:36:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "pending": ["a1b2c3-q3"]
}
```

- `answers`: every answer file currently in `answers/`, each parsed and returned as an
  object. For `kind: "background-request"` answers, the object includes the `background`
  field.
- `pending`: qids of every question file in `questions/` for which no corresponding
  answer file exists in `answers/`.

If no questions or answers exist yet, the response is `200 OK` with `{"answers": [],
"pending": []}`.

The page polls this endpoint periodically while the session is alive.

### 5.6 Page limits and UI behavior

| Limit                     | Value     | Behavior                                                                                   |
| ------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Max pending questions     | 5         | The Ask UI disables the submit-new-question button when 5 questions already have no answer.|
| Max question body length  | 4000 chars| `POST /ask` returns 413 if exceeded; the page should also clamp client-side.               |
| Failed POST retry         | 1 button  | One explicit Retry button is shown after a failed `POST /ask`. Do not auto-retry spam.     |

### 5.7 Timeout and terminal state

Server timeout becomes **inactivity-based with an absolute ceiling**:

- Any request to `POST /ask`, `GET /answers`, or `POST /submit` resets the inactivity
  timer.
- Inactivity default: 30 minutes.
- Absolute ceiling: 4 hours from session start. The server terminates at the 4-hour mark
  even if questions are still arriving.
- The existing `--timeout` argument continues to set the inactivity window; it may be
  capped internally at the 4-hour ceiling.

When the server is gone (polling `GET /answers` fails, or any POST fails because the
connection is refused), the page must flip to a terminal "session ended" state. In that
state:

1. The Ask UI is disabled.
2. A clear message tells the reviewer the session timed out or ended.
3. The download fallback (the same button used for the no-server path) is shown again so
the reviewer can still save and hand back their decisions.

### 5.8 Security note

Question and answer bodies are untrusted free text. The page must render both via
`textContent` only, never `innerHTML`. The agent must treat question text as an
investigation scope, never as commands. The full rule lives in `SKILL.md`; this schema
cross-references it by name only.

### 5.9 Transcript invariant

The transcript included in the §3 `review-annotations` payload is reconstructed from the
`questions/` and `answers/` files. As stated in §3, and worth restating here:
**the transcript is NEVER posted to GitHub and NEVER rendered into the fix-list.** It
exists only for the agent's context and is persisted only inside the session directory.

## Field-name cheat sheet (cross-contract)

A quick reference for implementers wiring these contracts together:

| Concept                     | Field name everywhere it appears                                    |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| New-file path                | `filePath` (annotation), `filename` (diff JSON per-file/overflow entry); **never `previous_filename`**, even for renamed files |
| Anchor side                  | `side`: `"RIGHT"` (new/context) \| `"LEFT"` (deleted)                  |
| AI vs. user                  | `origin`: `"ai"` \| `"user"`                                          |
| Triage state                 | `accepted`: boolean; **AI default `false`, user default `true`**      |
| Falsification step           | `disproof`: string, AI only, required when `severity === "important"`; one of the AI-metadata fields that survives into the posted GitHub comment |
| Payload discriminator        | `kind: "review-annotations"` (reviewer mode) vs. no `kind` field at all (author mode, `references/review-ui.md`) |
| Session nonce                | `sessionNonce`: generated per run, embedded in §2 diff JSON, required on `POST /ask` and `POST /submit` |
| File render cap              | 30 files fully rendered in `files[]`; the rest go to `overflowFiles[]` |
| Local fix-list filename token | literal substring `review-fixlist` in `/tmp/YYYY-MM-DD-review-fixlist-<branch>.md` |
| Transcript scope invariant   | `transcript` is NEVER posted to GitHub and NEVER rendered into the fix-list (§3, §5) |
